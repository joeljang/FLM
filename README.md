# Fine-tuning (Large) Language Models (under progress ‚è≥)

### Key Features üîë

1Ô∏è‚É£¬†Full use of computational resources (GPU Utilization)

- bf16, model parallelism, most optimal GPU utilization
- Support [Parameter Efficient Fine-tuning (PEFT)](https://github.com/huggingface/peft) with underlying PLM loaded in lower bits (int8())

2Ô∏è‚É£¬†Dynamically construct ANY kind of Training & Evaluation Dataset Combination

- Designate any # of instances for each training & validation dataset
- Allows instruction tuning & dynamic validation during training (beats T0 by +00%)
- Support all pre-training objective & fine-tuning objective (e.g. MLM, SSM, etc.)

3Ô∏è‚É£¬†Evaluate LLMs (even 175B LMs) on any kind of evaluation datasets (MMLU, BigBench, etc.) with [FlexGen](https://github.com/FMInference/FlexGen) support

- Support inference with both decoder-only LMs & encoder-decoder LMs
- Supports multiple types of verbalizer techniques (calibrazation, etc.)
- Supports all kinds of generative metrics (ROUGE, BLEU, MAUVE, etc.)

4Ô∏è‚É£¬†Log the training run via **wandb**
